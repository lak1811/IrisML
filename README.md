# IrisML
This project is based on using machine learning concepts to visualize and analyze the Iris dataset. To use this project, it is essential to run the code below in your CMD before you run the project file: 

```python
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
```

This project was made for me to learn about the usage of ML concepts in a practical scenario. Hence, i have at times used multiple ways to solve an issue, as using different kind of classifiers (which i did in classification.py since i used four classifiers, including a voting classifier). As said, this is made for me to learn aabout ML and understand how to use datasets in different ways. Enjoy the program!
