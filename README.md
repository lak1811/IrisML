# IrisML
This project is based on using machine learning concepts to visualize and analyze the Iris dataset. To use this project, it is essential to run the code below in your CMD before you run the project file:

```python
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
```

This project was made for me to learn about the usage of classifiers in a practical scenario. Hence, i have used four different kind of classifiers, which are Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest classifier, SVC classifier, KNeighbors classifier and lastly a voting classifier to compare them all. Usually, a project need no more than one classifier, but since this project was made as a learning project, this was added. Enjoy the program!
